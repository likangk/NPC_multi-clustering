# the drawbacks of applying traditional clustering methods to survival analysis
Hierarchical clustering (Eisen et al. 1998) has successfully
identified clinically relevant cancer subtypes in several
different studies (Alizadeh et al. 2000; Bhattacharjee et al.
2001; Sorlie et al. 2001; Beer et al. 2002; Lapointe et al. 2004).
However, one drawback to unsupervised learning procedures
is that they may identify cancer subtypes that are unrelated to
patient survival.
